#### The project is at its last step and is about to be uploaded.  

####  To solve any real-life problem, we need to understand the depth of problem first. One such problem is the assessment of patients suffering from mental disorder, so that we can diagnose them. Often, these patients are inaccurate or reluctant in expressing themselves due to several mental and social boundaries they surround themselves in. This tends to worsen up the patients in phycological aspect. These patients are not verbal about their situation, so we need to apply sophisticated techniques for a non-verbal assessment of patient’s pain.

 #### In the healthcare setting, performing an accurate assessment of patient’s pain level is an imperfect science. Certain traditional pain assessment methods rely significantly on a patient’s description of his or her pain level which may be confusing or inaccurate. While non-verbal pain assessments tools are available inherent bias, reliability and sensitivity are some of the challenges encountered regardless of the tool.

#### Thus, there is a need to access the pain severity score of a person using non-verbal techniques and train the techiques to self-improvise upon themselves. We also need to study the dependency on environmental factors responsible for the prediction using machine learning, so as to push their sadness to happiness.

#### The product being developed is a mobile application for android operating system. It is an emotion and pain assessment tool and can be incorporated on other platforms also, which satisfy the minimum requirements of system.

#### The application will allow the doctors to select or capture an image of the patient to be assessed. Then the image will be uploaded to the server and given to the Convolutional Neural Network model to process. The model is trained to generate score of each possible emotion. Then the severity algorithm will work on generated scores.
The result will be sent to app.

#### Future Improvements: We will be using sensors to collect information about system environments and other variables when the corresponding photos of patients are taken.  As the data will eventually grow it will understand dependency of each emotion on environment variables. Also, over a period of time it will optimize itself.
